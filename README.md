# SockeyeSize

This repository contains data and code for analysing changes in body size and contributions from shifting size-at-age and age structure of mature sockeye salmon returning to Bristol Bay, Alaska.

R code can be found in the 'code' folder, data are stored in the 'data' folder, output .csv files are saved to the 'output' folder, and figures are saved to the 'plots' folder. The six code files provided produce the results as follows:

1. 'BB-age-size-metrics.R' calculates and saves age-size metrics
2. 'BB-harvest-selection.R' calculates and saves selection differentials 
3. ‘BB-age-size-trends-main-figure.R’ produces Figure 2
4. ‘BB-SaA-contributions-figure.R’ produces Figure 3
5. ‘BB-SaA-contributions-over-time.R’ produces Figure 4
6. ‘BB-SaA-covar-model-baywide-RY.R’ produces Figures 5 and 6

Analyses were last run in R version 4.2.0.
