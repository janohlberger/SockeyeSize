# SockeyeSize

This repository contains data and code for analysing changes in body size and contributions from shifting size-at-age and age structure of mature sockeye salmon returning to Bristol Bay, Alaska.

R code can be found in the 'code' folder, data are stored in the 'data' folder, and output .csv and .pdf files are saved to the 'output' folder. The four code files provided produce the results figures as follows:

1. ‘BB_SaA-contributions.R’ produces Figure 3
2. ‘BB_SaA-contributions_over_time.R’ produces Figure 4
3. ‘BB_age_size_trends_main_figure.R’ produces Figure 2
4. ‘BB_SaA-covar-model-baywide-RY.R’ produces Figures 5,6,7

Analyses were last run in R version 4.2.0.
